# The Development of AI Technology in Chemical and Material Research

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has greatly enriched the toolbox for chemical and material research. In contrast to the successful prediction or optimization of a single property of materials, AI tools for the optimization of multiple objectives in a single task are yet to be developed, since such complexity is quite common in chemical engineering tasks.

## Integrated AI System for Multi-Objective Tasks

Herein, we have designed an integrated AI system including a managing team and a technical team for multi-objective tasks. Through prompt engineering, the integration of chemical tools, and the construction of a local knowledge base, this system can complete the entire process including analyzing scientific problems, in silicon material screening, and instructing experimental testing.

### Example: MOF Screening for CO2 Capture and Conversion

As demonstrated by the example of MOF screening for coupling CO2 capture and conversion, the system successfully identified a material Y-ABTC as a promising candidate. The experimental study demonstrated its capability for capturing CO2 from a CO2/N2 mixture (15/85) and in situ conversion to cyclic carbonate.
