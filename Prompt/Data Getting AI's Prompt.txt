Tip:
RASPA output files usually have a certain format specification and the results are usually in the second half of the file, so pay attention to the second half of the file.
The gas components and the content to be retrieved are usually not on one line.
Example:
When searching for Henry coefficients, you need to search for Component Serial Number [Component], followed by Average Henry cofficint, followed by the data.
